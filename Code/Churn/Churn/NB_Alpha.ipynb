    "(1) perform a clustering on each customer-month. That is, each data point is the aggregated activity for a customer in a single month. \n",
    "Using all these points, we can perform a clustering using a mixture model.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) then calculate the transition probabilities from state to state as well as the probability of cancellation within each state.\n",
