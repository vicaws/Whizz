Imbalanced data - the reason we don't mak them balanced is because we do not want to twist numerical value of churn rate. For example, if we balance the data set perfectly, then the population churn rate will become 50\%. After we do the clustering task, it is not straightforward to transform back the cluster churn rate for the balanced data set to that for the original imbalanced data set.
