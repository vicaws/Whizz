\section{Conclusion}

We derived the general weak form solution for a time-dependent Navier-Stokes equation, and then implemented in FEniCS to seek for the numerical solution for a specific problem. Moreover, we considered a diffusion-reaction process that acts as external force term on the flow, by coupling the governing PDEs into one compound system. The numerical results for flow velocity, pressure and chemicals concentration are displayed in color map. We discussed the evolution of these profiles over time, and also observed how the reaction impacting factor and fluid viscosity influence the velocity profile. Either larger $m$ or smaller $\nu$ results in a more irregular dynamics for the velocity in the long term.
